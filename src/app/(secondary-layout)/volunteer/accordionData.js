    question: "What if I don't know what my gifts are?",
    answer:
      "We encourage any new volunteers to try out whatever ministry they're interested in for at least 6 weeks. If at the end of these 6 weeks, you feel it's a poor fit, there's NO shame in recognizing that, and moving on to the next option on your list. At the very least, you will have eliminated an option."

  {
    question: "I have commitment issues.",
    answer:
      "That may be a problem for you... but not for us! If your commitmophobia is related to an unpredictable schedule, we are willing to be flexible and work with you. You can even volunteer to serve as little as once a month!"
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to have prior experience?",
    answer:
      "NOPE. We are willing to train all of our new volunteers, and will walk through everything with you. All that we require of you is a heart for what you're doing."
